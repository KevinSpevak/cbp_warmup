# Constraint-Based Planning Warmup Project
### Kevin Spevak, 2021

This project contains utilities for representing and manipulating propositional logic sentences and models in lisp, as well as implementations of some different SAT solving algorithms.

## Testing
test.lisp contains a script to test the SAT solving algorithms implemented in this repository. To run from the command line:

```> sbcl --script test.lisp```
